## Project Objectives
The main objective of the Edu Forum website is to provide students with a platform for interactive discussions and knowledge sharing. The key features aim to enable students to post questions, engage in discussions, rate content, and search for relevant information within their enrolled courses. Additionally, teachers have administrative functions to maintain the quality of content and manage student posts and comments.

## UI/UX Design
The user interface of the Edu Forum website is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. The index page serves as the login page with links to the forgot password and registration pages. Once logged in, users are presented with a dashboard displaying their enrolled courses. The header contains different buttons for students and teachers, such as "Join" and "Create," respectively.

When accessing a course, the page displays the course title, a list of questions, and a sidebar with tags for filtering. A search box is available to search for questions using keywords. Teachers have additional editing capabilities to manage posts and comments.

The student self-enrollment page provides filters by course categories or alphabetical order. For teachers, the page allows them to create courses instead of enrolling.

The user profile page displays the user's username, email, enrolled courses, and profile image. Users can change their passwords and profile images from this page.
